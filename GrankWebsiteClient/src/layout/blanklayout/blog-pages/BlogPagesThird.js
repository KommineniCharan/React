                  Are you also curious how search engine optimization & pay per
                  click are effective for brands? Moreover, can they work
                  together? It’s usual for tons of doubts to pop into your head
                  in this adventurous web world. The answer is yes, though.
                </p>
                <h5>
                  Let's explore how search engine optimization and PPC may best
                  complement one another to elevate your brand. Before that,
                  let's understand what SEO and PPC are.
                </h5>
                <h4>What is SEO?</h4>
                <h5>
                  Search engine optimization (SEO) is a method for enhancing
                  website visibility to rank on popular search engines and
                  increase organic website traffic.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Just as we use Google or Bing to find the greatest Chinese
                  food or to understand why digital marketing is important for
                  branding, so do your consumers. Investing time in SEO will
                  help your customers reach you whenever browsed for keywords
                  relating to a brand's products or services.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For instance, Struto naturally appears at the top of the
                  search engine results page if you search for the phrase
                  "digital marketing is important for branding."
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Make sure to have a solid SEO strategy to hit the goal. You
                  can beat out the competition and rank at the top of SERPs,
                  starting with the creation of high-quality content, link
                  building, on-page SEO, off-page SEO, changing algorithms, and
                  more.
                </h5>
                <h4>What is PPC?</h4>
                <h5>
                  Pay Per Click (PPC) is a part of Search Engine Marketing (SEM)
                  in which the advertiser pays search engines like Google or
                  Facebook for each click that the target audience makes on the
                  ad.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In this promotional strategy, you only pay when someone clicks
                  on your adverts. It only draws audiences that are interested
                  and tend to buy your goods or services, allowing you to
                  achieve favorable results.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For instance, you may see the "Ad" marker on the top results
                  when you browse for "digital marketing course."
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These ads often appear along with organic results. Every
                  country has a unique approach when running these campaigns.
                  While some are endeavoring to succeed in a cutthroat industry,
                  others may enter with a targeted marketing campaign with a set
                  start and end date. Either way, the goal is to connect with
                  the specific audience. However, the cost estimate for PPC ads
                  is centered on the specific industry and search volume of the
                  keyword you are bidding for.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Now that we have a better understanding, let's discover how
                  pay-per-click advertising and search engine optimization work
                  for companies.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  How can SEO and PPC work together for your website? Have a
                  look at the top 5 methods!
                </h5>
                <h4>SEO + PPC = Higher search engine visibility</h4>
                <h5>
                  Now that you know, PPC with a high bid can allow your brand to
                  be at the top of the window whereas Search engine optimization
                  boosts website ranking naturally. If both SEO and PPC are used
                  for the specific term, your brand or website might dominate
                  the search results. This increases the probability of
                  generating more organic and paid clicks.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  PPC helps you to retrieve lost search engine clicks
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Given that your site's already on top of SERP for the same
                  phrase via organic search, you would have assumed skipping
                  PPC. After all, why spend money to appear twice on the page?
                  But it's not that simple.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  According to the sources, a Google study reveals that 89
                  percent of the traffic generated by PPC ads cannot be replaced
                  by organic ranking if they are paused. In other words, traffic
                  derived from ads and organic traffic is different. So, if PPC
                  ads are paused, you could not only lose out on your viewers
                  but also can affect your brand and website.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Including PPC with SEO will aid you in recovering clicks that
                  you may have missed or were unable to meet organically.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Remarketing Campaigns (Ads) help you in reaching previous
                  traffic
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Assuming that your SEO strategies are bringing in a sizable
                  quantity of traffic to your websites. But does every visitor
                  instantly convert to your leads? Not really! They might need a
                  little convincing before they plan to buy your goods or
                  service. Before they forget about your goods, you may use SEO
                  and PPC to remarket to your visitors and entice them back for
                  sale.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For instance, when you search for a phone on Amazon, the same
                  product will appear as an advert on each website you visit.
                </h5>
                <h4>PPC enables you to test new SEO keywords</h4>
                <h5>
                  We are all aware that SEO takes some time to offer effective
                  outcomes. But what if you want to test a new phrase for your
                  brand? In this scenario, PPC ads are of great help. You can
                  simply add the focus keyword in your ad campaigns and monitor
                  results for a short time, maybe 1 or 2 weeks. If the
                  experiment turns out to be successful with the expected
                  outcomes, this is your cue to use a keyword for website
                  optimization. But if things go the other way, you know what to
                  do—just steer clear.
                </h5>
                <h4>
                  PPC & SEO delivers more data for a smart decision making
                </h4>
                <h5>
                  One of the reasons why search engine optimization & pay per
                  click are effective for brands is they can give you a bag full
                  of data.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The data gleaned from both methods, such as clickthrough
                  rates, time spent on site/ page, bounce rates, average session
                  times, conversion rates, exit rates, etc., paves the way for
                  better decisions. For example, you may forecast which keyword
                  will perform best or how many visitors shall turn into leads.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  True, the data were collected from different sources, but it
                  can likely support you in crafting a productive marketing
                  strategy for your brand.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Last Thoughts
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  SEO or PPC can be used separately or combined in your
                  marketing campaigns. While PPC does yield quick results,
                  search engine optimization is used to enhance the brand's
                  long-term growth. So, how do you intend to include PPC and SEO
                  in your marketing?
                  <br />
